            A <strong>distribution board</strong> (also known as <b>panelboard</b>, <b>breaker panel</b>, 
            <b>electric panel</b>, <b>fuse box</b> or <b>DB box</b>) is a component of an electricity supply system 
            that divides an electrical power feed into subsidiary circuits while providing a protective fuse or circuit 
            breaker for each circuit in a common enclosure. Normally, a main switch, and in recent boards, one or more 
            residual-current devices (RCDs) or residual current breakers with overcurrent protection (RCBOs) are also 
            incorporated.

            In the United Kingdom, a distribution board designed for domestic installations is known as a
            <strong>consumer unit</strong>.

            <strong>AC power plugs and sockets</strong> connect devices to mains electricity to supply them with 
            electrical power. A <b>plug</b> is the connector attached to an electrically-operated device, often via 
            a cable. A <b>socket</b> (also known as a <b>receptacle</b> or <b>outlet</b>) is fixed in place, often 
            on the internal walls of buildings, and is connected to an AC electrical circuit. Inserting 
            ("plugging in") the plug into the socket allows the device to draw power from this circuit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plugs and wall-mounted sockets for portable appliances became available in the 1880s, to replace 
            connections to light sockets. A proliferation of types were subsequently developed for both convenience 
            and protection from electrical injury. Electrical plugs and sockets differ from one another in voltage 
            and current rating, shape, size, and connector type. Different standard systems of plugs and sockets are 
            used around the world, and many obsolete socket types are still found in older buildings.
